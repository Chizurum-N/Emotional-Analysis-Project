# Emotional-Analysis-Project
Emotional Analysis
The above project involved some data cleaning using the tokenization and removing stopwords. I also use the library speller to correct spelling mistakes.
The project also involved use of a file called emotions.txt which contains a library of words and the emotions attached to them. Using this file I was able to conduct an emotional analysis against a letter written by the former home secretary of the United Kingdom Suella Braverman to see the emotions that were present in the letter that she wrote to the current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak upon his sacking her.
